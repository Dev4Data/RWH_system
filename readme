Weather data collection and Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) design python (3.9) scripts

Abstract:
    This scripts are my solution to find the best RWH system design for my own project.
    It collects the weather data from the visual-crossing API on a daily basis.
    And then uses the data and according to the given parameters from the /settings/settings.ini
    to calculate the RWH system performance.
    To visualize the performance some diagrams are saved in the /diagrams folder.

Content:
    Folders:
        _docs - descriptions
        data - location of the weather data
        diagrams - folder all the diagrams are saved in
        scripts - python script to start the process
        settings - ini files with
    Scripts:
        get_weather_data - script to collect and save the weather data in a csv file
        calc_rwh_system - here the system parameters are used to calc the performance of the system
        draw_chart - save png files of diagrams that are important to evaluate the RWH system performance
        setup_environment - just collects the configuration parameters and defines display parameters
    Parameter-files:
        key.ini with the visual-crossing API keys (private)
        settings.ini with all other parameters

How to:
    01. create the /settings/key.ini file first (Hint: you can add up to 10 keys)
        Fill it like this:
            [visualcrossing_private]
            key1 = ...
            key2 = ...
    02. set your latitude,longitude position in [location] section of the settings.ini
    03. run the get_weatherdata.py script and check the csv file
    04. fill the desired RWH system parameters in the [rwh] section of the settings.ini
    05. run the draw_charts.py script (calls the calc_rwh_system at the beginning)
    06. check the diagrams
